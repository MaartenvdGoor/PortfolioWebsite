# Ambitieproject (SD - 2024/2025)
Dit is het eerste deel van de Proeve van Bekwaamheid (PvB1): `het Ambitieproject`.

> Je hebt het goedgekeurde functioneel ontwerp (FDD) uit de voorbereiding op dit project nodig om te kunnen starten.


## Collect proof of work in the 'sintlucas' folder
* Any document you create (FDD.md, TDD.md, RETROSPECTIVE.md, REVIEW.md and any other document)
* Screenshots of your scrum board.
* Video of (or parts of) the working application.
* Screenshots of tests you did and the changes you made afterwards.
* ...

## General planning
A general planning a scrum master could use:
[GENERAL_PLANNING.md](sintlucas%2FGENERAL_PLANNING.md)

## Create a TDD (Technical Design Document)
Make sure that you understand how to build the application based on the functional design document:
* e.g. What stack/frameworks you will use (HTML/CSS/JS, Vue, Unity etc.)?
* e.g. How will the different parts work together (or how does the architecture look like)?
* e.g. If you're using OOP, what would the class diagram look like?
* e.g. Which data does your application need and how you will store it? Do you need an ERD diagram?
* e.g. How will you deploy it?
* e.g. Which parts won't be built?
* e.g. What are the risks?
* e.g. Are there any security risks and how will you deal with them?
* e.g. How important is the performance and how will you realise it?
* e.g. Who will maintain it?
* Add proof to the sintlucas folder.

## Prepare
* Create a scrum board in `GitHub Projects` with these columns:
  sprint backlog (ToDo), in progress, testing, done
* Place the requirements in `GitHub Issues` (which will act as your backlog).
* Prioritize the backlog items with the MoSCoW-method. Use a label in `GitHub Issues` to indicate the priority.
* Have a Sprint Planning meeting:
  * Decide which In this meeting you need to refine each user story (issue) into smaller, more technical items.
    Each item should be clear enough that it can be realised without further discussion.
  * Then estimate which items you can do in the first sprint (in this project a sprint takes 1 week).
  * Move them to the sprint backlog column on the scrum board.

## Realise: development
* Every time you start working on the project:
  * Open the scrum board
  * Answer these questions:
    * What did you do last time?
    * What will you do today?
    * Are there any impediments in your way?
* Start developing on the sprint backlog items (ToDo).

Don't forget:
* Commit and push your changes regularly.
* Check the result in the browser regularly.
* Make sure that your code is readable and has comments.
* Make sure that your code follows the code conventions.

## Test: bugfixing
* Test every backlog item.
* e.g. Test your code in different browsers and on different devices.
* e.g. Test the result for speed by using the LightHouse tool in the browser's Developer Tools.

## Present/Discuss: review
* Show the scrum board.
* Walk through its sprint backlog (ToDo) and show the result of each item.
* Write down the feedback you get in `REVIEW.md`.
* Add/change items to the backlog (issues) based on the feedback in `REVIEW.md`.

## Reflect: retrospective
When you finished a sprint, you need to reflect on the process to improve it.
This is called a retrospective.
Use the template in the `RETROSPECTIVE.md` file to write down the results of the retrospectives.

## Presentation & Assessment
* In the last week you will present the results:
  * Show the end product.
  * Explain (part of) the code you've written.
* Prepare for questions about your code.
* Know what you would do differently next time.
* See criteria in ASSESSMENT file in the sintlucas folder. 

## Video of your work
Create a video of the working application:
* Before the Presentation & Assessment, you must create a video of the working application.
* The video should show the main functionalities of the application.
* It should be a screencast with a voice-over.
* The video should be a maximum of 5 minutes long.
* Add the video to the `sintlucas` folder.
* Give the video a clear name, e.g. `video-ambitieproject-your-name.mp4`.
